%% Choosing a Control Desing Approach: 
% Architecture - PID loops with unit feedback (1-DOF and 2-DOF)
% - control systems having SISO controllers in single-loop or multiliip configs
% - any architecture including SISO or MIMO feedback loops 
% Control Design Approach: 
% - automatically tune PID gains to balance performance and robustness
% - graphically tune poles and zeros on design plots, such as Bode, rlocus, and Nichosl 
% - automatically tune compensators using response optimizaiton like LQG synthesis, IMC tuning 
% - automatically tune controller parameters to meet design req. you specify like setpoint tracking, stability margins, disturbance rejection, and loop shaping
% Analysis of Control System Performance: 
% - Time and frequency response for reference tracking and distrubance rejection
% - Any combination of system responses
% Interface: 
% - Graphical tuning using PID Tuner "Designing PID Controllers with PID Tuner"
% - Programmatic tuning using pidtune "PID Controller Design at the Comand Line" 
% - Graphical tuning using Control System Designer 
% - Graphical tuning using Control System Tuner 
% Programmatric tunin using 'systune'
